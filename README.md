# web-socket
WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables two-way, full-duplex communication between a client (typically a browser) and a server over a single, long-lived TCP connection.

⚙️ How it Works:
Initial Handshake: Starts as an HTTP request.

Protocol Upgrade: If both sides agree, the connection upgrades from HTTP to WebSocket.

Persistent Connection: The connection stays open — both sides can push messages.

Low Latency: Since the connection stays open, data exchange is much faster.
